A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential 
read-only collection of Char objects.
String objects are immutable: they cannot be changed after they have been created. 
All of the String methods and C# operators that appear to modify a string actually return the results in a 
new string object.
String operations in .NET are highly optimized and in most cases do not significantly impact performance. 
However, in some scenarios such as tight loops that are executing many hundreds or thousands of times, 
string operations can affect performance. The StringBuilder class creates a string buffer that offers 
better performance if your program performs many string manipulations. The StringBuilder string also 
enables you to reassign individual characters, something the built-in string data type does not support.
