C# is one of the newest programming languages.You might have heard about Visual Basic, C++, and Java.
Perhaps you’re wondering what the differences are between C# and these other programming languages. 
You might also be wondering whether you should be teaching yourself one of these three languages instead of C#.
Microsoft says that C# brings the power of C++ with the ease of Visual Basic. In fact, you can actually write many programs with less code using C#.
C# was meant to be an advance over both C++ and Java as a general purpose programming language.
Although it can be argued that some of its features are a step backward, C# clearly includes some constructs that move it beyond its predecessors.
Some of its features will surely be adopted by programming languages of the near-term future.
Although C# removes some of the features of C++ that cause programmers a lot of grief, no power or functionality was really lost.
Some of the programming errors that are easy to create in C++ can be totally avoided in C#. This can save you hours or even days in finishing your programs.
You’ll understand more about the differences from C++ as you learn C#.
You might also have heard of the C programming language. Many people wonder if they should learn C before learning C#, C++, or Java.
Simply put, there is absolutely no need to learn C first.
Another language that has gotten lots of attention is Java.
Java, like C++ and C#, is based on C. If you decide to learn Java later, you will find that a lot of what you learn about C# can be applied.
